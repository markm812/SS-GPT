# Summary
This is a learning repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a GPT-like language model for character-level text generation. The project structure includes the following key files:
- `dataset/data.txt`: The dataset used for training, containing text data.
- `model.pth`: The saved model file.
- `ss-gpt_dev_notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for development and experimentation.
- `train.py`: The main training script.

## Key Components

### `train.py`
- Defines various neural network components such as [`Head`](train.py#L69), [`MultiHeadAttention`](train.py#L98), [`FeedFoward`](train.py#L114), [`Block`](train.py#L130), and [`GPTLanguageModel`](train.py#L148).
- Implements the training loop, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
- Contains functions for batch generation and loss estimation.

### `ss-gpt_dev_notebook.ipynb`
- Provides an interactive environment for developing and testing the model.
- Includes code for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and text generation.

## Usage
1. Download the dataset and place it in the `dataset` directory.
2. Run `train.py` to train the model.
3. Use the saved model (`model.pth`) for text generation or further evaluation.

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a transformer-based language model and provides a foundation for further experimentation and development in natural language processing tasks.
